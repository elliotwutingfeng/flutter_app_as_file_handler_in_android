# flutter_app_as_file_handler_in_android

Simple demonstration of how to set your Android Flutter app to be a "file opener" for oddly specific filetypes like **.jpg.txt**.

For ease of use, the first commit is the default Flutter app template; `flutter create flutter_app_as_file_handler_in_android`; demonstration is from second commit onwards.
